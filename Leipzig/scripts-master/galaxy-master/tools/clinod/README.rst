Galaxy wrapper for Command line NoD predictor (v1.3)
====================================================

This wrapper is copyright 2011-2013 by Peter Cock, The James Hutton Institute
(formerly SCRI, Scottish Crop Research Institute), UK. All rights reserved.
See the licence text below.

Command line NoD predictor is a tool for predicting nucleolar localization
sequences (NoLSs) in a FASTA file of proteins using a neural network. There
is also a webtool version at http://www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/www-nod/

This NoD wrapper is available from the Galaxy Tool Shed at:
http://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/peterjc/clinod


Automated Installation
======================

This should be straightforward, Galaxy should automatically download and install
the JAR file for clinod v1.3 and the batchman executable from the Stuttgart
Neural Network Simulator (SNNS), and set the ``$CLINOD`` to their folder.


Manual Installation
===================
This wrapper expects the java binary to be on the system PATH, and to be able
to access command line NoD as ``$CLINOD/clinod-1.3.jar`` which means if you
used ``/opt/clinod/clinod-1.3.jar`` set the environment variable ``$CLINOD``
to ``/opt/clinod``

Internally NoD calls the binary batchman v1.0 from the Stuttgart Neural Network
Simulator (SNNS) v4.2 or 4.3 software suite. This binary can either be on the
system path or located next to the JAR file, i.e. ``/opt/clinod/batchman``

To install the wrapper copy or move the following files under the Galaxy tools
folder, e.g. in a ``tools/clinod`` folder:

* ``clinod.xml`` (the Galaxy tool definition)
* ``README.rst`` (this file)

You will also need to modify the ``tools_conf.xml`` file to tell Galaxy to offer the
tool. If you are using other protein analysis tools like TMHMM or SignalP, put
it next to them. Just add the line::

  <tool file="clinod/clinod.xml" />

If you wish to run the unit tests, also add this to ``tools_conf.xml.sample``
and move/copy the ``test-data`` files under Galaxy's ``test-data`` folder. Then::

    $ ./run_functional_tests.sh -id clinod

That's it.

Developers
==========

This script and related tools were initially developed on the following hg branch:
http://bitbucket.org/peterjc/galaxy-central/src/tools

Development has now moved to a dedicated GitHub repository:
https://github.com/peterjc/pico_galaxy/tree/master/tools/clinod

For making the "Galaxy Tool Shed" http://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/ tarball use
the following command from the Galaxy root folder::

    $ tar -czf clinod.tar.gz tools/clinod/README.rst tools/clinod/clinod.xml tools/clinod/tool_dependencies.xml test-data/four_human_proteins.fasta test-data/four_human_proteins.clinod-1.3.tabular

Check this worked::

    $ tar -tzf clinod.tar.gz
    tools/clinod/README.rst
    tools/clinod/clinod.xml
    tools/clinod/tool_dependencies.xml
    test-data/four_human_proteins.fasta
    test-data/four_human_proteins.clinod-1.3.tabular
