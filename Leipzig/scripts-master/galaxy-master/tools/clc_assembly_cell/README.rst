Galaxy wrapper for the CLC Assembly Cell suite from CLCbio
==========================================================

CLC Assembly Cell is the commercial command line assembly suite from CLCbio.
It uses SIMD instructions to parallelize and accelerate their assembly
algorithms, and is also very memory efficient making it an appealing choice
for complex genomes where the RAM requirements exclude other popular tools.

You can download the CLC Assembly Cell User Manual here, currently v4.2

There is also an online manual here:

There is currently a free trial download here:

This wrapper is available from the Galaxy Tool Shed at:
http://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/peterjc/clc_assembly_cell

This Galaxy wrapper was written and tested using CLC Assembly Cell
version 4.10.86742


Automated Installation
======================

This should be straightforward, Galaxy should automatically download and
install the wrapper from the Galaxy Tool Shed. However, you will need to
manually install the CLC Assembly Cell software, and setup the environment
variable ``$CLC_ASSEMBLY_CELL`` to the directory containing the binaries
(and in particular, the ``clc_assembler`` binary). For example:

$ export CLC_ASSEMBLY_CELL=/opt/clcbio/clc-assembly-cell-4.1.0-linux_64/


Manual Installation
===================

First install the CLC Assembly Cell sortware as described above.

To install the wrapper copy or move the following files under the Galaxy tools
folder, e.g. in a tools/clcbio folder:

* clc_assembler.xml (Galaxy tool definition)
* clc_mapper.xml (Galaxy tool definition)
* README.rst (this file)

You will also need to modify the tools_conf.xml file to tell Galaxy to offer the
tools. Just all these line, for example next to other assembly tools::

  <tool file="clc_assembly_cell/clc_assembler.xml" />
  <tool file="clc_assembly_cell/clc_mapper.xml" />

If you wish to run the unit tests, also add this to tools_conf.xml.sample
and move/copy the test-data files under Galaxy's test-data folder. Then::

    $ ./run_functional_tests.sh -id clc_assembler

That's it.

Development is on this itHub repository:
https://github.com/peterjc/pico_galaxy/tree/master/tools/clc_assembly_cell

For making the "Galaxy Tool Shed" http://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/ tarball use
the following command from the Galaxy root folder::

    $ tar -czf clcbio.tar.gz tools/clc_assembly_cell/README.rst tools/clc_assembly_cell/clc_assembler.xml tools/clc_assembly_cell/clc_mapper.xml tools/clc_assembly_cell/tool_dependencies.xml

Check this worked::

    $ tar -tzf clcbio.tar.gz
    tools/clc_assembly_cell/README.rst
    tools/clc_assembly_cell/clc_assembler.xml
    tools/clc_assembly_cell/clc_mapper.xml
    tools/clc_assembly_cell/tool_dependencies.xml
