Galaxy tool to sub-sample sequence files
========================================

This tool is copyright 2014 by Peter Cock, The James Hutton Institute
(formerly SCRI, Scottish Crop Research Institute), UK. All rights reserved.
See the licence text below (MIT licence).

This tool is a short Python script (using Biopython library functions)
to sub-sample sequence files (in a range of formats including FASTA, FASTQ,
and SFF). This can be useful for preparing a small sample of data to test
or time a new pipeline, or for reducing the read coverage in a de novo
assembly.

This tool is available from the Galaxy Tool Shed at:

* http://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/peterjc/sample_seqs


Automated Installation
======================

This should be straightforward using the Galaxy Tool Shed, which should be
able to automatically install the dependency on Biopython, and then install
this tool and run its unit tests.


Manual Installation
===================

There are just two files to install to use this tool from within Galaxy:

* ``sample_seqs.py`` (the Python script)
* ``sample_seqs.xml`` (the Galaxy tool definition)

The suggested location is in a dedicated ``tools/sample_seqs`` folder.

You will also need to modify the ``tools_conf.xml`` file to tell Galaxy to offer the
tool. One suggested location is in the filters section. Simply add the line::

    <tool file="sample_seqs/sample_seqs.xml" />

You will also need to install Biopython 1.62 or later. If you want to run
the unit tests, include this line in ``tools_conf.xml.sample`` and the sample
FASTA files under the ``test-data`` directory. Then::

    ./run_functional_tests.sh -id sample_seqs

That's it.

For making the "Galaxy Tool Shed" http://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/ tarball use
the following command from the Galaxy root folder::

    $ tar -czf sample_seqs.tar.gz tools/sample_seqs/README.rst tools/sample_seqs/sample_seqs.py tools/sample_seqs/sample_seqs.xml tools/sample_seqs/tool_dependencies.xml test-data/ecoli.fastq test-data/ecoli.sample_N100.fastq test-data/ecoli.pair_sample_N100.fastq test-data/get_orf_input.Suis_ORF.prot.fasta test-data/get_orf_input.Suis_ORF.prot.sample_N100.fasta test-data/get_orf_input.Suis_ORF.prot.pair_sample_N100.fasta test-data/MID4_GLZRM4E04_rnd30_frclip.sff test-data/MID4_GLZRM4E04_rnd30_frclip.sample_N5.sff test-data/MID4_GLZRM4E04_rnd30_frclip.pair_sample_N5.sff
