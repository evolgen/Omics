This wrapper is available from the Galaxy Tool Shed at:

Automated Installation
======================

This should be straightforward, Galaxy should automatically download and install
the Jar files for effectiveT3 v1.0.1 and the three models (animal, plant and std).


Manual Installation
===================

You can change the path by setting the environment variable ``$EFFECTIVET3`` to the
relevant folder, but by default it expects the following files to be installed
at these locations::

    /opt/EffectiveT3/TTSS_GUI-1.0.1.jar
    /opt/EffectiveT3/module/TTSS_ANIMAL-1.0.1.jar
    /opt/EffectiveT3/module/TTSS_PLANT-1.0.1.jar
    /opt/EffectiveT3/module/TTSS_STD-1.0.1.jar

To install the wrapper copy or move the following files under the Galaxy tools
folder, e.g. in a tools/effectiveT3 folder:

* ``effectiveT3.xml`` (the Galaxy tool definition)
* ``effectiveT3.py`` (the Python wrapper script)
* ``README.rst`` (this file)

Also copy ``effectiveT3.loc.sample`` to ``effectiveT3.loc`` in the ``tool-data``
folder (and edit if appropriate, e.g. to add or remove a model).

You will also need to modify the ``tools_conf.xml`` file to tell Galaxy to offer the
tool. If you are using other protein analysis tools like TMHMM or SignalP, put
it next to them. Just add the line::

  <tool file="effectiveT3/effectiveT3.xml" />

If you wish to run the unit tests, also add this to ``tools_conf.xml.sample``
and move/copy the ``test-data`` files under Galaxy's ``test-data`` folder. Then::

    $ ./run_functional_tests.sh -id effectiveT3

That's it.

Developers
==========

This script and related tools were initially developed on the following hg branch:
http://bitbucket.org/peterjc/galaxy-central/src/tools

Development has now moved to a dedicated GitHub repository:
https://github.com/peterjc/pico_galaxy/tree/master/tools/effectiveT3

For making the "Galaxy Tool Shed" http://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/ tarball use
the following command from the Galaxy root folder::

    $ tar -czf effectiveT3.tar.gz tools/effectiveT3/README.rst tools/effectiveT3/effectiveT3.xml tools/effectiveT3/effectiveT3.py tools/effectiveT3/tool_dependencies.xml tool-data/effectiveT3.loc.sample test-data/four_human_proteins.fasta test-data/four_human_proteins.effectiveT3.tabular test-data/empty.fasta test-data/empty_effectiveT3.tabular


Check this worked::

    $ tar -tzf effectiveT3.tar.gz
    tools/effectiveT3/README.rst
    tools/effectiveT3/effectiveT3.xml
    tools/effectiveT3/effectiveT3.py
    tools/effectiveT3/tool_dependencies.xml
    tool-data/effectiveT3.loc.sample
    test-data/four_human_proteins.fasta
    test-data/four_human_proteins.effectiveT3.tabular
    test-data/empty.fasta
    test-data/empty_effectiveT3.tabular
