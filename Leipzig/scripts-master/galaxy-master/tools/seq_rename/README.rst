Galaxy tool to rename FASTA, QUAL, FASTQ or SFF sequences
=========================================================

This tool is copyright 2011-2014 by Peter Cock, The James Hutton Institute
(formerly SCRI, Scottish Crop Research Institute), UK. All rights reserved.
See the licence text below.

This tool is a short Python script (using Biopython library functions) to rename
sequences from a FASTA, QUAL, FASTQ, or SFF file based on an ID mapping gives as
two columns of a tabular file. The output order follows that of the sequence file,
and if there are duplicates in the input sequence file, there will be duplicates
in the output sequence file.

This tool is available from the Galaxy Tool Shed,

* http://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/peterjc/seq_rename

See also the sister tools to filter or select sequence files according to IDs
from column(s) of tabular file:

* http://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/peterjc/seq_select_by_id


Automated Installation
======================

This should be straightforward using the Galaxy Tool Shed, which should be
able to automatically install the dependency on Biopython, and then install
this tool and run its unit tests.


Manual Installation
===================

There are just two files to install to use this tool from within Galaxy:

* ``seq_rename.py`` (the Python script)
* ``seq_rename.xml`` (the Galaxy tool definition)

The suggested location is in a dedicated ``tools/seq_rename`` folder.

You will also need to modify the ``tools_conf.xml`` file to tell Galaxy to offer the
tool. One suggested location is in the filters section. Simply add the line::

    <tool file="seq_rename/seq_rename.xml" />

If you wish to run the unit tests, also add this to ``tools_conf.xml``.sample
and move/copy the ``test-data`` files under Galaxy's ``test-data`` folder. Then::

    $ ./run_functional_tests.sh -id seq_rename

You will also need to install Biopython 1.54 or later. That's it.

Developers
==========

This script and related tools were initially developed on the following hg branch:
http://bitbucket.org/peterjc/galaxy-central/src/tools

Development has now moved to a dedicated GitHub repository:
https://github.com/peterjc/pico_galaxy/tree/master/tools

For making the "Galaxy Tool Shed" http://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/ tarball use
the following command from the Galaxy root folder::

    $ tar -czf seq_rename.tar.gz tools/seq_rename/README.rst tools/seq_rename/seq_rename.* tools/seq_rename/tool_dependencies.xml test-data/four_human_proteins.fasta test-data/four_human_proteins.rename.tabular test-data/four_human_proteins.rename.fasta

Check this worked::

    $ tar -tzf seq_rename.tar.gz
    tools/seq_rename/README.rst
    tools/seq_rename/seq_rename.py
    tools/seq_rename/seq_rename.xml
    tools/seq_rename/tool_dependencies.xml
    test-data/four_human_proteins.fasta
    test-data/four_human_proteins.rename.tabular
    test-data/four_human_proteins.rename.fasta
