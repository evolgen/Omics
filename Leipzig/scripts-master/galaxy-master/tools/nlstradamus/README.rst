Galaxy wrapper for NLStradamus v1.7 or v1.8 (C++ version)
=========================================================

This wrapper is copyright 2011-2013 by Peter Cock, The James Hutton Institute

NLStradamus is a command line tool for predicting nuclear localization
signals (NLSs) in a FASTA file of proteins using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM).

This wrapper is available from the Galaxy Tool Shed at:

Early versions of NLStradamus did not have a native tabular output format, this
was added in version 1.7. Additionally a fast C++ implementation was added at
this point (early versions of NLStradamus came as a perl script only).

Version 1.8 fixed a C++ compilation issue on modern compilers, but is otherwise
unchanged.


Automated Installation
======================

This should be straightforward, Galaxy should automatically download and install
the C++ implementation of NLStradamus v1.8, and run the unit tests.


Manual Installation
===================
This wrapper expects the compiled C++ binary "NLStradamus" to be on the system
PATH.

To install the wrapper copy or move the following files under the Galaxy tools
folder, e.g. in a tools/protein_analysis folder:

* ``nlstradamus.xml`` (the Galaxy tool definition)
* ``nlstradamus.txt`` (this README file)

You will also need to modify the ``tools_conf.xml`` file to tell Galaxy to offer the
tool. If you are using other protein analysis tools like TMHMM or SignalP, put
it next to them. Just add the line (matching the chosen install path)::

  <tool file="protein_analysis/nlstradamus.xml" />

If you wish to run the unit tests, also add this to ``tools_conf.xml.sample``
and move/copy the ``test-data`` files under Galaxy's ``test-data`` folder. Then::

    $ ./run_functional_tests.sh -id nlstradamus

That's it.

Developers
==========

This script and related tools were initially developed on the following hg branch:
http://bitbucket.org/peterjc/galaxy-central/src/tools

Development has now moved to a dedicated GitHub repository:
https://github.com/peterjc/pico_galaxy/tree/master/tools/nlstradamus

For making the "Galaxy Tool Shed" http://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/ tarball use
the following command from the Galaxy root folder::

    $ tar -czf nlstradmus.tar.gz tools/nlstradamus/README.rst tools/nlstradamus/nlstradamus.xml tools/nlstradamus/tool_dependencies.xml test-data/four_human_proteins.fasta test-data/four_human_proteins.nlstradamus.tabular test-data/empty.fasta test-data/empty_nlstradamus.tabular

Check this worked::

    $ tar -tzf nlstradmus.tar.gz
    tools/nlstradamus/README.rst
    tools/nlstradamus/nlstradamus.xml
    tools/nlstradamus/tool_dependencies.xml
    test-data/four_human_proteins.fasta
    test-data/four_human_proteins.nlstradamus.tabular
    test-data/empty.fasta
    test-data/empty_nlstradamus.tabular
