Galaxy wrapper for samtools idxstats
====================================

This wrapper is copyright 2013-2014 by Peter Cock, The James Hutton Institute
(formerly SCRI, Scottish Crop Research Institute), UK. All rights reserved.
See the licence text below.

This is a wrapper for part of the command line samtools suite, v0.1.19

This wrapper is available from the Galaxy Tool Shed at:
http://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/peterjc/samtools_idxstats


Automated Installation
======================

This should be straightforward, Galaxy should automatically download and install
samtools 0.1.19 if required.


Manual Installation
===================

This expects samtools to be on the $PATH, and was tested using v0.1.19.

To install the wrapper copy or move the following files under the Galaxy tools
folder, e.g. in a ``tools/samtools_idxstats`` folder:

* ``samtools_idxstats.xml`` (the Galaxy tool definition)
* ``samtools_idxstats.py`` (the Python wrapper script)
* ``README.rst`` (this file)

You will also need to modify the ``tools_conf.xml`` file to tell Galaxy to offer
the tool. Just add the line, perhaps under the NGS tools section::

  <tool file="samtools_idxstats/samtools_idxstats.xml" />

If you wish to run the unit tests, also add this to ``tools_conf.xml.sample``
and move/copy the ``test-data`` files under Galaxy's ``test-data`` folder. Then::

    $ ./run_functional_tests.sh -id samtools_idxstats

That's it.

Developers
==========

Development is on this GitHub repository:
https://github.com/peterjc/pico_galaxy/tree/master/tools/samtools_idxstats

For making the "Galaxy Tool Shed" http://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/ tarball use
the following command from the Galaxy root folder::

    $ tar -czf samtools_idxstats.tar.gz tools/samtools_idxstats/README.rst tools/samtools_idxstats/samtools_idxstats.xml tools/samtools_idxstats/samtools_idxstats.py tools/samtools_idxstats/tool_dependencies.xml test-data/ex1.bam test-data/ex1.idxstats.tabular

Check this worked::

    $ tar -tzf samtools_idxstats.tar.gz
    tools/samtools_idxstats/README.rst
    tools/samtools_idxstats/samtools_idxstats.xml
    tools/samtools_idxstats/samtools_idxstats.py
    tools/samtools_idxstats/tool_dependencies.xml
    test-data/ex1.bam
    test-data/ex1.idxstats.tabular
