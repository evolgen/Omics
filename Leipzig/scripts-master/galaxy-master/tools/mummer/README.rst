This wrapper is available to install into other Galaxy Instances via the Galaxy
Tool Shed at http://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/peterjc/mummer

Automated Installation
======================

This should be straightforward, Galaxy should automatically download and install
the MUMmer files.

It also needs gnuplot, and ps2pdf.


Manual Installation
===================

This expects MUMmer binaries (at least ``mummer``, ``nucmer``, ``promer``, and
``mummerplot``) and the tools ``gnuplot`` and ``ps2pdf`` to be on the system
``$PATH``.

To install the wrapper copy or move the following files under the Galaxy tools
folder, e.g. in a ``tools/mummer`` folder:

* ``mummer.xml`` (the Galaxy tool definition)
* ``mummer.py`` (the Python wrapper script)
* ``README.rst`` (this file)

You will also need to modify the ``tools_conf.xml`` file to tell Galaxy to offer the
tool. Just add the line::

  <tool file="mummer/mummer.xml" />

If you wish to run the unit tests, also add this to ``tools_conf.xml.sample``
and move/copy the ``test-data`` files under Galaxy's ``test-data`` folder. Then::

    $ ./run_functional_tests.sh -id mumerplot_wrapper

That's it.

For making the "Galaxy Tool Shed" http://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/ tarball use
the following command from the Galaxy root folder::

    $ tar -czf mummer.tar.gz tools/mummer/README.rst tools/mummer/mummer.xml tools/mummer/mummer.py tools/mummer/tool_dependencies.xml

Check this worked::

    $ tar -tzf mummer.tar.gz
    tools/mummer/README.rst
    tools/mummer/mummer.xml
    tools/mummer/mummer.py
    tools/mummer/tool_dependencies.xml
