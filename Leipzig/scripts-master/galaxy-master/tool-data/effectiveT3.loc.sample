# This is a three column tab separated file to define the modules (models)
# for the Effective T3 prediction tool.
#
# Column 1 - Module ID, string that Galaxy will save in its database
# Column 2 - Human readable name, Galaxy will show this in the UI
# Column 3 - Filename, Galaxy will use this when calling the tool
#
#NOTE: In EffectiveT3 v1.0.1, the modules are given as their filename
#(with the JAR extension) but without any path. They are expected to
#be located in a subdirectory called module under the working directory.
#For the galaxy wrapper, we assume this means under the folder where the
#main JAR file is, TTSS_GUI-1.0.1.jar
#
#e.g.
#
# /opt/EffectiveT3/TTSS_GUI-1.0.1.jar
# /opt/EffectiveT3/module/TTSS_STD-1.0.1.jar
# /opt/EffectiveT3/module/TTSS_ANIMAL-1.0.1.jar
# /opt/EffectiveT3/module/TTSS_PLANT-1.0.1.jar
#
#See files ../tools/protein_analysis/effectiveT3.* for more details,
