This is package is a Galaxy workflow for comparing three RXLR prediction
methods with a Venn Diagram, and creates a FASTA file of any proteins
passing all three methods.

See http://www.galaxyproject.org for information about the Galaxy Project.


Availability
============

This workflow is available to download and/or install from the main
Galaxy Tool Shed:

http://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/peterjc/rxlr_venn_workflow

Test releases (which should not normally be used) are on the Test Tool Shed:

http://testtoolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/peterjc/rxlr_venn_workflow

Development is being done on github here:

https://github.com/peterjc/pico_galaxy/tree/master/workflows/rxlr_venn_workflow


Sample Data
===========

This workflow was developed and run on several *Phytophthora* species.
For example, try the "Phyca11" protein set for *Phytophthora capsici*:

http://genome.jgi-psf.org/Phyca11/download/Phyca11_filtered_proteins.fasta.gz

You can upload this directly into Galaxy via this URL. Galaxy will handle
removing the gzip compression to give you the FASTA protein file which
has 19,805 protein sequences. The expected results:

* 89 RXLRs using Whisson et al. (2007)
* 124 RXLRs using Win et al. (2007)
* 162 RXLRs using Bhattacharjee et al. (2006)

Of these, only 79 sequences pass all three of the RXLR prediction tools,
while 19643 have no RXLR matches at all.

Dependencies
============

These dependencies should be resolved automatically via the Galaxy Tool Shed:

* http://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/peterjc/tmhmm_and_signalp
* http://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/peterjc/seq_filter_by_id
* http://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/peterjc/venn_list

However, at the time of writing those Galaxy tools have their own dependencies
required for this workflow which require manual installation (SignalP v3.0,
HMMER v2.0, and the R/Bioconductor package limma).
