# Michigan Geomicrobiology Lab
General scripts used in the lab. Almost all of them are in core Perl/Python, i.e require no modules that don't already come with a Perl/Python installation. These scripts are currently in use by the Lab, so expect full support. Please refer to **contents.list** to find descriptions and location of scripts.<br>
Please do let us know if you find any bugs or easier/quicker/more elegant solutions.<br>
